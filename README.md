## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive log of my learning journey 
as I navigate through Codecademy's Data Scientist: Natural Language 
Specialist career path. Here, you will find various projects, assignments, 
and personal notes that chronicle my progress and reflect my learning 
curve in the domain of Data Science and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

_Note: For now, this repository will start at the project Frida Kahlo and move forward._
